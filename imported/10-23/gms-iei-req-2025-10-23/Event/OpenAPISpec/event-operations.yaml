      summary: Find Events outside a time range that are associated to SignalDetections inside the time range
      description: This operation returns Event objects that have a preferredEventHypothesisByStage EventHypothesis occurring outside the provided time range that is associated to a SignalDetectionHypothesis that occurs inside the provided time range and is associated to any Station in the provided collection. The provided Station objects may be populated as entity references. An Event occurs outside of the time range if its preferredEventHypothesisByStage collection contains an EventHypothesis for any provided Stage that has a peferredLocationSolution with time occurring before signalDetectionStartTime or after signalDetectionEndtime. The start time and end time are exclusive; if the preferredLocationSolution time is exactly equal to signalDetectionStartTime or is exactly equal to signalDetectionEndTime, the Event is not outside the time range. A SignalDetectionHypothesis occurs inside of the time range if its ARRIVAL_TIME FeatureMeasurement has an arrivalTime value in the time range beginning at signalDetectionStartTime and ending at signalDetectionEndTime. Both signalDetectionStartTime and signalDetectionEndTime are inclusive; a value exactly equal to one of these bounds is in the time range. After finding a matching Event, this operation returns within the Event each EventHypothesis created in a provided Stage. The returned Event objects are populated according to the default faceted attribute population defined in the COI data model except some of the EventHypothesis objects in their eventHypotheses collections may be populated objects instead of id-only references. The EventHypothesis objects that were stored on or after changedSinceTime are populated according to the default faceted attribute population defined in the COI data model; all other EventHypothesis objects are populated as id-only references. If changedSinceTime is not provided, all EventHypothesis objects are populated according to the default faceted attribute population defined in the COI data model.

    post:
      summary: Find events with detections and segments by time
      description: This operation finds the Event objects occurring in the time range provided in the query predicate. An Event occurs in a time range if its preferredEventHypothesisByStage entry for any provided Stage includes an EventHypothesis with a preferredLocationSolution with time occurring in the time range beginning at startTime and ending at endTime (both startTime and endTime are inclusive; a value exactly equal to one of these bounds is in the time range). After finding an Event is within the time range, this operation returns within the Event each EventHypothesis created in a provided Stage. Faceted attributes of the returned Event objects are populated according to the default faceted attribute population defined in the COI data model, with the exception of the EventHypothesis collection which is populated with the default faceted attribute instantiations (i.e. rather than reference only default population defined in the COI data model). Additionally, this operation returns a collection of SignalDetection objects (each including populated SignalDetectionHypothesis objects), for each SignalDetection with a SignalDetectionHypothesis associated to any EventHypothesis included within the returned Event collection. Further, this operation returns a ChannelSegment collection containing the measured ChannelSegment objects referenced by the FeatureMeasurement objects in the returned SignalDetectionHypothesis objects. Within the returned ChannelSegment objects, this operation populates the maskedBy ProcessingMask objects, leaving their maskedQcSegmentVersions populated as identifier-only instances. This operation returns an EventsWithSignalDetectionsAndSegments object combining the loaded Event, EventHypothesis, SignalDetection, SignalDetectionHypothesis, and ChannelSegment objects. An optional changedSinceTime parameter limits the Event objects returned to those that contain EventHypothesis objects that were stored on or after the changedSinceTime. For each returned Event, EventHypothesis objects stored on or after changedSinceTime are fully populated; all other EventHypothesis objects are populated as id-only references. Similarly, each populated EventHypothesis object's associated SignalDetectionHypothesis objects, along with any other SignalDetectionHypothesis objects in their SignalDetection histories that were stored on or after changedSinceTime, are fully populated; all other SignalDetectionHypothesis objects in the returned SignalDetection objects are populated as id-only references. Faceted attributes of the returned EventHypothesis and SignalDetectionHypothesis are populated according to the default faceted attribute population defined in the COI data model.

    post:
      summary: Stores the provided Event, SignalDetection, and ChannelSegment objects, updating an Event object if it was previously stored.
      description: "Stores the provided Event, SignalDetection, and ChannelSegment objects, updating an Event object if it was previously stored. Stores each of the provided Event objects or updates an Event object if it was previously stored. Stores each of the provided SignalDetection objects or updates a SignalDetection object if it was previously stored. SignalDetection objects are associated to the Event by being associated to the SignalDetectionHypothesis objects in the associatedSignalDetectionHypotheses collections of the EventHypothesis objects. The ChannelSegment objects associated to the provided SignalDetection objects are contained in the provided ChannelSegment object collection. For every SignalDetection object that could not be updated or stored, whether due to an inconsistency with a previously stored SignalDetection object or another issue, all Event objects with associated SignalDetectionHypothesis objects contained within that SignalDetection object's signalDetectionHypotheses collection are not stored. The ChannelSegment objects are associated to the Event objects through the Event objects' associated EventHypothesis objects' associated SignalDetectionHypothesis objects' FeatureMeasurement objects' measuredChannelSegment and analysisWaveform, the associated EventHypothesis objects' associated LocationSolution objects' associated LocationBehavior objects' FeatureMeasurement and FeaturePrediction objects, and the associated LocationSolution objects' associated NetworkMagnitudeSolution objects' associated FeatureMeasurement objects, and are associated to the provided SignalDetection objects through the FeatureMeasurement objects' measuredChannelSegment and analysisWaveform.
        For a given Event, checks if that Event was previously stored. If that Event was previously stored, checks that the previously stored Event is consistent with the current Event. The current Event is consistent with the previously stored Event if all EventHypothesis objects in the previously stored Event object's eventHypotheses created in the provided Stage are contained within the current Event object's eventHypotheses collection and all EventHypothesis objects in the previously stored Event object's finalEventHypothesisHistory are contained within the current Event object's finalEventHypothesisHistory in the same order, with all new EventHypothesis objects in the history appearing after the previous Event object's finalEventHypothesisHistory EventHypothesis objects. If the current Event is consistent with the previously stored Event, updates the previously stored Event with the current Event, otherwise does not store the current Event. Event objects are not partially stored; either the entire Event aggregate is stored or nothing is stored. For a given Event, the check for consistency and storage of the aggregate Event, along with the associated SignalDetection objects and ChannelSegment objects should be a single atomic transaction to prevent a race condition from happening if two versions of the same Event with inconsistent eventHypotheses collections are stored simultaneously.
        Stores the Event aggregate by storing the Event (when updating a previously stored Event, the previousEventHypothesisbyStage and eventHypotheses collections should be updated to include the new results for the provided Stage) and all EventHypothesis objects in the Event object's eventHypotheses that were not previously stored. New SignalDetectionHypothesis objects associated to the EventHypothesis are stored by storing the provided SignalDetection objects. New ChannelSegment objects are stored by storing the provided ChannelSegment objects. New Channel objects associated with the EventHypothesis should also be stored; the new Channel objects will likely be derived Channel objects. The Data Fabric will typically have previously received these associated derived Channel objects through a Channel storage request-response service operation. The aggregate Event should only be stored if its associated SignalDetection objects and ChannelSegment objects were successfully stored. For every successfully stored or updated object, sets the object's storage time to the current wall-clock time.
        See endpoint /signal-detection/update for a ChannelSegment storage description. See endpoint /waveform/channel-segment/store for a SignalDetection storage description."
