      summary: List all events
      description: |
        Retrieve a list of all events with optional filtering by time range, location, and other criteria.
        
        **Time Filtering Examples:**
        - Last 24 hours: startTime=2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z&endTime=2025-10-29T00:00:00.000Z
        - Specific hour: startTime=2025-10-29T14:00:00.000Z&endTime=2025-10-29T15:00:00.000Z
        - Last week: startTime=2025-10-22T00:00:00.000Z&endTime=2025-10-29T00:00:00.000Z
        - Real-time monitoring: endTime=2025-10-29T18:45:30.500Z (no startTime for all historical)
        
        **Location Examples:**
        - Regional: latitude=37.7749&longitude=-122.4194&radiusKm=100 (San Francisco Bay Area)
        - Global seismic: latitude=35.0&longitude=139.0&radiusKm=1000 (Japan region)
        
        **Combined Filtering:**
        - Recent events near station: startTime=2025-10-29T00:00:00.000Z&latitude=69.5355&longitude=25.5063&radiusKm=50

      summary: FDSN DataSelect - Retrieve seismic waveform data
      description: |
        **FDSN DataSelect Web Service (v1.1)**
        
        Retrieve seismic time series data in miniSEED format following the FDSN dataselect specification.
        This service provides access to continuous waveform data from seismic stations.
        
        **Common Usage Patterns:**
        - Download continuous data: `/fdsn/dataselect/1/query?net=IU&sta=ANMO&starttime=2025-10-29T00:00:00&endtime=2025-10-29T01:00:00`
        - Multiple stations: `/fdsn/dataselect/1/query?net=IU&sta=ANMO,CCM&starttime=2025-10-29T00:00:00&endtime=2025-10-29T01:00:00`
        - Specific channels: `/fdsn/dataselect/1/query?net=IU&sta=ANMO&cha=BHZ&starttime=2025-10-29T00:00:00&endtime=2025-10-29T01:00:00`
        
        **Data Format:** Returns miniSEED binary data by default.
